## Fashion MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

## Tools Used:
Fashion MNIST Classification uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

numpy - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
pytorch - An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment
matplotlib - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms
torchvision - The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision
